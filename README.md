# Pet the corgi!

this is a totally useless website where you can pet a corgi and make it spin!

https://petthecorgi.netlify.app/

# Installation

1. Clone the project and open it with your code editor.
2. Open index.html with live server/live preview. 

# Code Review

1. `script.js:29` - Click on the area around the cute corgi dog also triggers the rotation which could be solved with using `button.addEventListener` instead of `window.addEventListener` 👍
2. `style.css:6-9` - Maybe you could add a transitiion to make the change of background colour smoother ✨
3. `style.css:` - Corgie image width can be set to % to make it scale better into mobile view 🐶
4. `script.js:9-18` - Try to using more than and less than when setting conditions for numbers that goes under a certain amount eg: `count > 10`instead of `count === 10` 🧮
5. `script.js:20-26` - Its recommended to put functions inside of a const eg `const blueBackground = function()`instead of `function blueBackground()` 🐱
